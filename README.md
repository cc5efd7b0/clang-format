This is a completely private repository, but I haven't set it to private because I want to be able to fetch the `.clang-format` file and `.clang-tidy` file from anywhere using curl.  
```sh
curl -O https://cc5efd7b0.github.io/clang-tools-cfg/.clang-format
```
```sh
curl -O https://cc5efd7b0.github.io/clang-tools-cfg/.clang-tidy
```
